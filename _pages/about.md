Hey there ðŸ‘‹. I'm a computer science Master student at Saarland University and
member of the [Operating Systems Group](https://os.mpi-sws.org/) at the Max
Planck Institute for Software Systems under the supervision of my namesake
[Antoine Kaufmann](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~antoinek/). There, I am working
on the full-system simulation framework
[SimBricks](https://simbricks.github.io/).

More generally, I enjoy playing around with hard- and software to figure out
what makes a system tick and perform decently. During my time at the university,
I have developed a particular interest in Operating Systems, Distributed
Systems, High-Performance Networking, Software Engineering, as well as some
theory here and there. I enjoy applying the obtained knowledge and combining it
with existing state-of-the-art work to build something even more useful.

Lately, I've been mostly looking into custom hardware development for offloading
intense computations and the high-performance interfaces between hard- and
software that enable significant speed-ups through tight integration.
