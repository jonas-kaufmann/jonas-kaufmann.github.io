Hey there, I'm a computer science student at Saarland University and a member of
the [Operating Systems Group](https://os.mpi-sws.org/) at the Max Planck
Institute for Software Systems under the supervision of my namesake [Antoine
Kaufmann](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~antoinek/). There, I am helping to develop
the full system simulation framework [SimBricks](https://simbricks.github.io/)
as well as spinning off my own project
[ACâš¡DSim](/assets/pdf/sosp_src_acdsim_poster.pdf).

Generally, I enjoy playing around with hard- and software to figure out what
makes it perform decently or run efficiently. During my time at the university,
I developed a particular interest in Operating Systems, Distributed Systems,
High-Performance Networking, Software Engineering, as well as also some theory
here and there. It's a lot of fun applying the obtained knowledge and combining
it with existing state-of-the-art work and approaches to build something new and
even more useful.
